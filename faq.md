# FAQ

Quick answers to common questions.

## Account & Setup

### How do I create an account?
Go to the OutreachGuy website and click Sign Up. Enter your email, create a password, and verify your email.

### Can I use OutreachGuy with multiple X accounts?
Yes! You can connect multiple X accounts to the same project. Each account can run its own missions.

### How do I connect my X account?
Go to Channels > Connect Account > Connect X Account. You'll be redirected to X to authorize the connection.

### Is my X account safe?
Yes. OutreachGuy uses official X authentication (OAuth). We never see your X password. You can disconnect anytime.

## Missions & Powers

### What's the difference between missions and powers?
Missions run automatically on a schedule. Powers are instant actions you trigger manually.

### How do I stop a mission?
Open the mission and toggle off "Automation." The mission will pause until you turn it back on.

### Can I edit a mission after creating it?
Yes. Open the mission and click the Configure tab to change the name, brief, or schedule.

### Why didn't my mission run?
Check that:
- The mission is not paused
- You have enough energy
- Your X account is still connected

## Leads

### How does OutreachGuy find leads?
The AI searches X for people showing interest in topics related to your business. It looks for buying signals like "looking for recommendations" or "need help with."

### Can I export my leads?
Yes. Go to Leads and click Export CSV to download all your lead data.

### What's a lead score?
The score indicates how likely someone is to be a good fit. Higher scores mean stronger buying signals or better profile matches.

## Billing & Energy

### What is energy?
Energy is the credit system that powers your actions. Posts, replies, and DMs all use energy.

### How much does each action cost?
- Post = 1 energy
- Reply = 2 energy
- DM = 3 energy

### What happens when I run out of energy?
Your missions will pause. You can upgrade your plan, enable auto-recharge, or wait for your next monthly refill.

### Can I cancel my subscription?
Yes, anytime. Go to Settings > Plan to manage your subscription.

## AI Chat

### What can I ask the AI?
Almost anything related to your outreach:
- Write content
- Find leads
- Analyze your performance
- Get strategy advice

### Does the AI remember previous conversations?
Yes. Each conversation keeps its history, and you can continue past conversations from the History page.

### Can the AI post directly to X?
Yes. The AI can take actions like posting, replying, and sending DMs—not just give suggestions.

## Troubleshooting

### My X account shows a yellow status
This means the connection needs attention. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your account.

### The AI isn't doing what I asked
Try being more specific in your request. Instead of "engage with people," try "find 5 tweets about marketing tools and reply with helpful tips."

### I'm not seeing any leads
Make sure your missions are set up to find leads. Check that your brief includes instructions to look for potential customers.
