# Missions

Missions are the heart of OutreachGuy. They're automated tasks that run on a schedule, doing outreach for you while you focus on other things.

## What is a mission?

A mission is a set of instructions you give to the AI. You describe what you want in plain English, and the AI figures out how to do it.

For example:
- "Find tweets about marketing automation and reply with helpful tips"
- "Post 3 times a day about AI tools"
- "Send a friendly DM to new followers"

## Creating a mission

1. Go to **Missions** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Mission**
3. Give your mission a name (e.g., "Daily engagement")
4. Write your brief — describe what you want the AI to do
5. Choose a schedule
6. Click **Create**

Your mission is now active!

## Writing a good brief

The brief is where you tell the AI what to do. Be clear and specific:

**Good brief:**
> "Find tweets from people looking for project management tools. Reply with a helpful tip and mention our tool if relevant. Keep replies friendly and not salesy."

**Too vague:**
> "Engage with people"

Tips for writing briefs:
- Describe the type of content to look for
- Explain how you want to engage (reply, like, DM)
- Set the tone (friendly, professional, casual)
- Mention any topics to avoid

## Scheduling options

Choose how often your mission runs:

- **One-time** — Runs once at a specific time
- **Daily** — Runs every day at a set time
- **Weekly** — Runs on specific days each week
- **Custom** — Set your own interval

You can change the schedule anytime.

## Running a mission manually

Don't want to wait for the schedule?
1. Open the mission
2. Click **Run Now**

The mission will execute immediately.

## Pausing and resuming

Need to stop a mission temporarily?
1. Open the mission
2. Toggle **Automation** off

Turn it back on when you're ready to resume.

## Viewing mission history

See what your mission has been doing:
1. Open the mission
2. Click the **History** tab

You'll see a log of every time the mission ran and what it did.

## Understanding energy costs

Each action uses energy (credits):
- **Post** = 1 energy
- **Reply** = 2 energy
- **DM** = 3 energy

When creating a mission, you'll see an estimate of how much energy it will use. Keep an eye on your energy balance in your account settings.

## Managing your missions

In the Missions page, you can:
- **Search** — Find missions by name
- **Filter** — Show only active or paused missions
- **Switch views** — See missions as cards, list, table, or calendar

## Tips for effective missions

- Start with one or two missions and see how they perform
- Check the history regularly to make sure the AI is on track
- Adjust your brief if the results aren't what you expected
- Use different missions for different goals (engagement vs. lead gen)
