# Plans & Billing

OutreachGuy uses an energy system to power your outreach. Here's how it works.

## Understanding energy

Energy is the credit system that powers your actions. Every time OutreachGuy posts, replies, or sends a DM, it uses energy.

### Energy costs

| Action | Energy |
|--------|--------|
| Post a tweet | 1 |
| Reply to a tweet | 2 |
| Send a DM | 3 |

The more outreach you do, the more energy you use.

## Estimating your usage

Before choosing a plan, think about how much outreach you want to do:

- **Light use** — A few posts and replies per day
- **Moderate use** — Regular posting plus engagement with leads
- **Heavy use** — High-volume outreach with lots of DMs

The pricing page has a slider to help you estimate your monthly energy needs.

## Choosing a plan

OutreachGuy offers different plans based on your needs. Each plan includes:
- A monthly energy allowance
- Access to features (some features are only on higher plans)
- Support options

Visit the Pricing page in the app to see current plans and pricing.

## Managing your subscription

To view or change your plan:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Click **Plan**

Here you can:

## Auto-recharge

Running low on energy? You can enable auto-recharge:
