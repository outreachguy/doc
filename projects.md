# Projects

Projects help you organize your work in OutreachGuy. Each project is like a separate workspace for a brand, business, or campaign.

## What is a project?

A project contains:
- Your connected X accounts
- Your missions and powers
- Your leads and targets
- Your AI conversation history

If you manage multiple brands or businesses, you can create a separate project for each one.

## Creating a new project

1. Click on your current project name in the sidebar
2. Click **Create Project**
3. Complete the setup wizard:
   - Choose your account type (Company or Creator)
   - Select your goals
   - Add your website or describe your business
   - Connect your X account

Your new project is ready to use!

## Switching between projects

1. Click on your current project name in the sidebar
2. Select the project you want to switch to

The project you're currently working in is highlighted with a badge.

## Project settings

To manage your project:

1. Go to **Settings**
2. Click **Data** or **Knowledge**

Here you can:
- **Restart onboarding** — Go through setup again to update your goals
- **Rescan website** — Update the information about your business
- **Manage channels** — Add or remove connected X accounts
- **View missions** — See all missions in this project

## Tips

- Keep each brand in its own project for cleaner organization
- Your AI assistant learns about each project separately, so it gives better suggestions
- You can have different missions and powers active in different projects
