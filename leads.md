# Leads

OutreachGuy helps you find and manage potential customers. These are your leads—people who might be interested in what you offer.

## How OutreachGuy finds leads

The AI searches X for people showing buying intent. It looks for signals like:
- "Looking for a tool to help with..."
- "Anyone have recommendations for..."
- "Need help with..."

When it finds someone who might be a good fit, it saves them as a lead.

## Viewing your leads

1. Go to **Leads** in the sidebar
2. You'll see a list of all discovered leads

For each lead, you can see:
- **Profile** — Their name, username, and bio
- **Score** — How likely they are to be a good fit (higher is better)
- **Status** — New, contacted, or ignored
- **When found** — The date they were discovered

## Lead details

Click on any lead to see more:
- Their full profile information
- The tweet or post where they showed interest
- Your interaction history with them
- Notes you've added

## Managing lead status

Keep track of where each lead is in your pipeline:

- **New** — Just discovered, not contacted yet
- **Contacted** — You've reached out to them
- **Ignored** — Not a good fit

To change status, open the lead and select a new status.

## Targets

Targets are high-value accounts you want to engage with regularly. These might be:
- Competitors' followers
- Industry influencers
- Potential partners

The Targets tab helps you track these accounts and reminds you to engage with them.

> Note: Targets are available on the Company plan.

## Filtering and searching

Find specific leads using:
- **Search** — Look for leads by name or username
- **Date filter** — Show leads from a specific time period
- **Status filter** — Show only new, contacted, or ignored leads
