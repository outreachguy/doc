# Powers

Powers are quick actions you can run anytime. Think of them as shortcuts for common tasks.

## What are powers?

Unlike missions (which run on a schedule), powers are instant. You click, and they run right away.

Examples of powers:
- "Reply to 5 high-engagement tweets in my niche"
- "Generate a viral tweet about my product"
- "Find 10 leads interested in marketing tools"

## Using powers

### From the Home page
Your favorite powers appear as chips at the top of your dashboard. Just click one to run it.

### From the Powers page
1. Go to **Powers** in the sidebar
2. Browse or search for a power
3. Click to run it

## Favoriting powers

Want quick access to powers you use often?

1. Go to **Powers**
2. Click the star icon on any power
3. Starred powers will appear on your Home dashboard

## Organizing your powers

You can reorder your powers by dragging them. Put your most-used powers at the top.

## Customizing a power

Each power has a prompt that tells the AI what to do. You can edit it:

1. Go to **Powers**
2. Click the edit icon on a power
3. Change the name or prompt
4. Save

This lets you tailor powers to your specific needs.

## Powers vs. Missions

| Powers | Missions |
|--------|----------|
| Run instantly when you click | Run automatically on a schedule |
| Great for one-off tasks | Great for ongoing automation |
| You trigger them manually | They run in the background |

Use powers when you want to do something right now. Use missions when you want things to happen automatically.

## Tips

- Star your most-used powers for quick access
- Edit power prompts to match your brand voice
- Use powers to test ideas before turning them into missions
