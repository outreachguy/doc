# AI Chat

The AI Chat is your personal assistant inside OutreachGuy. Ask it questions, get help with your outreach, or let it do tasks for you.

## Talking to the AI

1. Go to **Chat** in the sidebar (or use the composer at the bottom of the Home page)
2. Type your message
3. Press Enter or click Send

The AI will respond and can take actions for you.

## What you can ask

The AI assistant knows about your project and can help with many things:

### Get help with content
- "Write a tweet about our new feature"
- "Give me 5 post ideas about marketing"
- "Help me reply to this tweet"

### Find and engage with people
- "Find 10 leads interested in AI tools"
- "Search for tweets about project management"
- "Who should I engage with today?"

### Manage your account
- "How is my account performing?"
- "What missions are running?"
- "Show me my recent activity"

### Learn and strategize
- "What content is trending in my niche?"
- "How can I grow my followers faster?"
- "What's working best for my engagement?"

## Multiple conversations

You can have multiple chat tabs open at once:
- Click the **+** to start a new conversation
- Switch between tabs to continue different threads
- Each conversation keeps its own history

## Viewing chat history

All your past conversations are saved:

1. Go to **History** in the sidebar
2. Browse or search your conversations
3. Click one to reopen it

You can rename conversations to keep them organized.

## Tips for better results

- **Be specific** — "Find tweets about email marketing tools" works better than "find leads"
- **Give context** — "Write a reply to this tweet that sounds helpful, not salesy"
- **Ask follow-ups** — The AI remembers the conversation, so you can refine as you go
- **Let it take action** — The AI can post, reply, and engage directly—not just give suggestions

## The AI assistant and your project

The AI knows about your project—your business, target audience, and goals. This means it can:
- Write content in your brand voice
- Find leads that match your ideal customer
- Give advice based on your specific situation

The more you use OutreachGuy, the better the AI understands your needs.
