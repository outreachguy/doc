# Connecting Your Account

To post, reply, and engage on X (Twitter), you need to connect your X account to OutreachGuy.

## Why connect your account?

When you connect your X account, OutreachGuy can:
- Post tweets on your behalf
- Reply to relevant posts
- Send direct messages
- Find and engage with leads
- Track your account growth

You stay in control—OutreachGuy only does what you ask it to do.

## How to connect

1. Go to **Channels** in the sidebar
2. Click the **Connect Account** tab
3. Click **Connect X Account**
4. You'll be redirected to X to authorize the connection
5. Review the permissions and click **Authorize**
6. You're connected!

## Managing connected accounts

In the **Connected Accounts** tab, you can see all your linked X accounts. For each account, you'll see:

- **Profile picture and username**
- **Status** — Whether the connection is healthy (green) or needs attention (yellow)
- **Capabilities** — What OutreachGuy can do: Posts, Replies, DMs, Leads
- **Last sync** — When we last checked your account

## Disconnecting an account

If you need to disconnect:
1. Go to **Channels**
2. Find the account you want to remove
3. Click **Disconnect**

Your data stays safe—disconnecting just removes OutreachGuy's access to post on your behalf.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection shows yellow status
This usually means the connection needs to be refreshed. Try disconnecting and reconnecting.

### Can't authorize on X
Make sure you're logged into the correct X account before authorizing.

### Missing capabilities
Some features require specific X account settings. Check that your X account allows third-party apps.

## Multiple accounts

You can connect multiple X accounts to the same project. This is useful if you manage several accounts for the same brand.

Each account can have its own missions and powers.
